public class GetAllAvailableTeamsQuery
{
    // CONTEXT
    // Even though this class is empty I left it, because
    // 1) It matches the convention of having ...Query and ...QueryHandler classes across all application handlers
    // 2) It makes the extending the fetching all teams mechanism easier (for example: some filtering-related props which will be immediately available in query handler)
